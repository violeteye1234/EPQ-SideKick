        <!--About This Project-->
        <h2>About This Project</h2>
        <p class = "Intro">I, Pooja Zenit Shah, in the year of AS, worked on this project with my assessor-Mr.Hu. As I have a great interest in programming and was willing to create something for a good purpose, I decided to work on this project called "EPQ SideKick". This EPQ project's intention is to help other students in regards to their EPQ project with time management. I hope that this website is able to help students facilitate students with their managed time, focusing on academics, EPQ, and extra curricular activities. Through this website, students would not need to stress on their EPQ as much and can focus on the other factors. This project is made using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. These languages took a part in my AS IT syllabus. Through this project, I was able to learn these languages much in depth and not be limited by the specification's requirements.</p>
